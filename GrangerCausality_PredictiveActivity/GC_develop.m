%From first readings fairly straightforward to try this.  Main issue is
%method only seems to work if data is stationary.  There are transforms we
%can use to make data stationary but we can't apply these to our
%catagorical data.  First use the built in tools to check if we have issues
%with stationarity.  If we don't have issues give this a go to see what
%results we get.  If we do have issues, see again if we can find some kind
%of forced markov model where the transition probabilities are a continuous
%function of the neural data.  Though that does sound a hell of a lot like
%just redriving multinomial regression/if mnr didn't work then I'm not sure
%this will work.

%% Load data.

%% Test stainoarity.

%% Transform data if needed

%% Plot data, run gctest

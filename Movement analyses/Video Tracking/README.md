# Deep learning-based video tracking of natural monkey behavior

Recent advances in deep learning-based computer vision have enabled semi-automated tracking of animal behavior from video. We leverage these advances to conduct monkey detection, tracking, and pose estimation. We later use the output of these models for neural analyses. 

The principal packages we use include: [mmdetection for developing object detection and tracking models](https://mmdetection.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), [mmpose for developing pose estimation models](https://mmpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and [Roboflow for helpful labeling and visualization](https://roboflow.com/). We'd also like to acknowledge [DeepLabCut](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) and [SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/) as many analyses and visualizations were inspired by these prior works.

Finally, integrating computer vision-based tracking into neuroscience experiments is a bit of pain.

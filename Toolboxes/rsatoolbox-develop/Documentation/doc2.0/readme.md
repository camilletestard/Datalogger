Representational similarity analysis toolbox
===================================

AUTHOR LIST

# Overview 
The representational similarity analysis (RSA) toolbox provides functions for estimating, visualizing similarities between condition-specific activity patterns measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The toolbox is designed for fMRI analysis, but the methods can easily be applied for single-unit, local-field potential, muscle activity responses. This readme page just briefly summarizes the contents of the toolbox and short comments. 

The functions provided in the toolbox can be categorized into different categories:
